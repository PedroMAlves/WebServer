# TCP WebServer
WebServer in Java - Exercise from week 8 of the #8 BootCamp @ <Academia de Código_> in Fundão.
This was an exercise to implement I/O reading and writting (InputStreams and OutputStreams), networking (TCP and Sockets) and the newly learned concept of MultiThreading. NetCat and Chrome Developer Tools were used as an aid to test the webserver.
